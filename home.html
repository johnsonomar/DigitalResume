				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Hello, My name is Omar Johnson. I was born and raised in Brookyln, New York and am a proud New Yorker. I am a student here at BMCC. I am a CIS major and I have a deep love for computers. I have been building computers and taking them apart since middle school. I have always had an appetite for knowledge and understanding the inner workings of the things around me. I like to spend my free time reading and delving into philosophy. Philosophy as a subject holds a dear place within my heart. I enjoy the transformative power of knowledge and I think that this is something that ought to be shared with everyone.</p>
